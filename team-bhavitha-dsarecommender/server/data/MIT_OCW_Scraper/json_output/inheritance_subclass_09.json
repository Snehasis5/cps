  "content": "Subclasses like `Cat`, `Person`, and `Student` inherit from a parent class `Animal`. They can define their own `__init__` methods and override existing methods like `__str__` and `speak`. This shows polymorphism in action, where different subclasses behave differently even when using inherited structure."
